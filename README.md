# Ping-Pong App with Kubernetes Monitoring

Welcome to the Ping-Pong App repository! Here, you'll find all the code and configurations needed to deploy a simple Flask Ping-Pong application on a Kubernetes cluster, complete with Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.

## Features

- **Flask Ping-Pong Application**: This lightweight Flask application is designed to respond with a 'pong' message whenever it's pinged. It's a basic yet functional example to demonstrate deployment on Kubernetes.

- **Kubernetes Deployment and Service**: Kubernetes manifests (`deployment.yaml` and `service.yaml`) are included to seamlessly deploy the Ping-Pong application on your Kubernetes cluster. These files define how the application should be run and how it can be accessed within the cluster.

- **Dockerfile**: The Dockerfile provided here allows you to containerize the Ping-Pong application. Containerization ensures consistency across different environments and simplifies deployment.

- **Terraform Automation**: The Terraform configuration (`main.tf`) automates the process of provisioning a Kubernetes cluster using KinD, deploying the Ping-Pong application, and setting up Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring. With Terraform, you can easily manage your infrastructure as code.

## Prerequisites

Before diving in, make sure you have the following tools installed on your local machine:

- Docker: for containerization of the Ping-Pong application.
- Kubernetes: for deploying and managing containerized applications.
- Terraform: for automating the provisioning and management of your infrastructure.

## Getting Started

Ready to get started? Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Repository Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Deploy on Kubernetes with Terraform**:

   Refer to the instructions provided in the `terraform/README.md` file to deploy the Ping-Pong application and set up monitoring using Terraform.

4. **Access the Application**:

   Once the deployment is complete, access the Ping-Pong application by sending a GET request to the `/v1/ping` endpoint.

5. **Monitor with Grafana**:

   Use Grafana to monitor various metrics related to your Kubernetes cluster and the Ping-Pong application. Follow the setup instructions provided in the Grafana section to configure and access the Grafana dashboard.
